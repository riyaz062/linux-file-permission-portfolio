# Linux File Permissions – Portfolio Project

This project documents my hands-on practice with Linux file and directory permissions.
The goal was to understand how access control helps protect sensitive data.

## What I Practiced
- Viewing file permissions using `ls -l`
- Modifying permissions with `chmod`
- Securing hidden files
- Restricting directory access

## Tools Used
- Linux (Bash)
- chmod, ls, cd

## Learning Outcome
This activity helped me understand the principle of least privilege and how improper
permissions can lead to security risks.
